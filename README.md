<h1>Create a Raid Array</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this exciting demonstration, we will create a powerful RAID array using four  SATA hard drives. We'll be adding two dynamic volumes with distinct purposes:

First up is the Editing volume, specially designed to store massive amounts of raw video files that are crucial for top-notch editing. With this volume, we'll have lightning-fast access to all of our video content, ensuring a seamless editing experience.

Next, we have the Media volume, a high-capacity storage solution built to house all of our digital photos and completed video files. And the best part? This volume is designed to provide fault tolerance in case of drive failure, giving us the ultimate peace of mind.

So get ready to witness the power of our RAID array!
